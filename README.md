# cookieblob

a utilitarian discord bot for server admins

## Self hosting

The project is licensed under version 3 of the GPL however there are a few exceptions:

-   No using the cookieblob name in your bot.
-   No monetization of cookieblob.
-   No hosting a public version of cookieblob.
-   No providing others with support with self hosting cookieblob instances.

## contributions

i'm happy to accept your contributions but if it's about a new feature then please make an issue first so we can discuss wether this should actually be added.
