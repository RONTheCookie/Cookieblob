# cookieblob

a utilitarian discord bot for server admins

## selfhosting

the project is licensed under version 3 of the GPL howver there are a few exceptions:

-   no using the cookieblob name in your bot
-   no monetization of cookieblob
-   no hosting a public version of cookieblob
-   no providing others with support with self hosting cookieblob instances

## contributions

i'm happy to accept your contributions but if it's about a new feature then please make an issue first so we can discuss wether this should actually be added.

## add the bot to your server
